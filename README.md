# HCI prototype by Kei              studentID: 19126089
* java GUI for the XSpread command line spreadsheet. 

# How to use?
* Open it up in netbeans and run.
* When JSheets starts up, a get started will show up to provide you info/tutorial

# About opening and saving spreadsheets
* By default JSheets will open a file chooser/browser that shows your pc home directory when clicking the save or open button.
* Opening a file just requires clicking on a .csv or .sc file, which will loaded into the cells.
* Saving a sheet is saved in format .csv or .sc.
* Currently only supports .csv and .sc formats.

# Limitations
* Default Javafx does not provide libraries that help make spreadsheet functionality easy to implement, For example, this implementation you must press enter after entering data into a cell. Although some functionality can be built from scratch, this is not feasible for HCI since this unit focuses on UI design rather than building specific functionality, time constraints are also another reason.
